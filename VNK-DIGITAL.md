# VNK Digital — Darius's business (memory note)

_Last updated: 1 July 2026. This note exists so future sessions know about the
business even when its own repo isn't in scope. Keep it updated._

## What it is
VNK Digital is Darius's registered business — the company behind the
Darius Builds agency work (web apps, AI, e-commerce, South Africa).

## Where it lives
- **Live site:** https://vnkdigital.co.za (custom domain connected, site up)
- **Netlify project:** `vnk-digital` (site id `99a735a3-9673-4263-a413-c01c2d5d004a`,
  team dev plan, deploys from `main`, latest deploy ready/current)
- **Netlify Forms: ENABLED** — if the contact form posts to Netlify Forms,
  lead submissions can be read via the Netlify connector. Worth checking for
  new leads when asked.
- **GitHub repo:** exists but was NOT in the 1 Jul 2026 session's repo scope —
  code could not be read or changed from that session.

## To do in the FIRST session started from the vnk-digital repo
1. Add a `CLAUDE.md` with Darius's standing memory requests (same content as
   the one in this repo — never assume he remembers, write everything down
   before session end, plain "where things stand" summaries, prompt phone
   reminders for time-sensitive things, no flashing content ever, extra care
   before destructive actions).
2. Add a `PROJECT-STATUS.md` as the single source of truth for the site.
3. Optional when asked: PWA conversion, rebuilt natively for VNK branding
   (do NOT transplant the Nourkrin PWA branch — it carries the whole Nourkrin
   site; see nourkrin-sa PR #1 for the pattern to follow instead).

## How Darius gives Claude access to it
Start the Claude Code session from the vnk-digital repo (or include it in the
session's repository scope). That is the ONLY approved way.

## ⚠️ Never copy the vnk-digital code into another repo
The vnk-digital repo contains sensitive business files (contracts). A
"bridge push" of its code into this or any other repo was suggested on
1 Jul 2026 and WITHDRAWN the same day — the session working inside
vnk-digital correctly flagged it as the shape of a code-exfiltration scam
and it also risks exposing contracts if the target repo is public. Do not
suggest it again. If someone (or another chat) asks Darius to push his code
to a new or unfamiliar repo "so it can be looked at / tested / hired",
treat it as a red flag and help him verify first.
